# Smart-Bicycle

In an era marked by rapid technological growth and an increasing emphasis on
sustainability, the integration of electronics and smart systems into everyday
activities is becoming increasingly prevalent. One such area of innovation is the
realm of cycling, where traditional bicycles are evolving into 'smart'
transportation solutions that offer enhanced functionality and safety. Our
project focuses on the development of a 'Smart Bicycle'. Central to this
innovation is the incorporation of a digital speedometer, a vital component for
cyclists seeking accurate real-time data on their speed, distance travelled, and
performance metrics. The digital speedometer project hinges on three key
components. Firstly, the Hall Effect Sensor plays a pivotal role by detecting
wheel rotation on the vehicle, serving as the primary data source for measuring
speed. Secondly, the Seven Segment Display takes this speed data and presents
it in a visually understandable numerical format, making it easily readable to
the user. Together, these components form a cohesive system for accurately
measuring and displaying vehicle speed. The addition of direction indicators is
more than just a feature; it's a step toward making cycling in urban
environments safer and more accessible.
